### About
This is a personal website created using HTML and CSS through the React.js framework. It contains three
pages detailing personal information, interests, and projects. The code for each page is located in the `components`
directory which is in the `src` directory. All the images/attachments used are in the `images` folder, also in the
`src` folder. The `public` directory contains deployment information along with the `CNAME` file. To load the webpage,
simply type **ashnajay.me** into your browser.
